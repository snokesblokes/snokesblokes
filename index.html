      <p>
        Hi! You're probably here because you're a part of the <strong>SnokesBlokes</strong> squad on Star Wars Commander. Welcome to the team!
      </p>

      <h2>Why am I Here?</h2>
      <p>
        We are a war squad. We're good at it because we adhere to a consistent team strategy. To be a Bloke, we require all members to follow said strategy. Teamwork is key to winning wars!
      </p>

      <p>
        Please see squad policies and guidelines below.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Base Capability</h3>
          <p>
            Please have your base's defensive capability comparable to its level. Having a level 7 base with a level 5 defense is a liability we can't afford. We'll usually check this when you join and let you know if your base needs work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your attack capability will show itself over time. Feel free to ask questions though, as the team is happy to help you in becoming a formidable attacker.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Participation</h3>
          <p>
            In each war you have 3 attacks. You must use <strong>every</strong> one of your attacks in each war. If you have doubts on how to use them, ask a squad officer for tactical advice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Squad members that aren't using attacks will be removed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Opting Out</h3>
          <p>
            If you know that you won't be able to participate in a war, let us know. We know you have a life with family, work, school, vacation, etc... and won't always be available. Let an officer know so we can temporarily take you off the war squad. We do this all the time and giving the heads-up is appreciated!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Donations</h3>
          <p>
            Donations are critical in that you're giving them and you're giving the right kind. Squad members will let you know exactly what they need to do their best. Please donate per request and <strong>do not</strong> donate troops or vehicles that aren't requested.  We realize, though, that to fill the request you'll probably need to top the member off with a couple of stormtroopers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sullust donation requests are critical for wars.</strong> Squad members will often state <strong>exactly</strong> what they need on Sullust. Donating other kinds of troops or vehicles is unacceptable and will be grounds for immediate dismissal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if the squad member doesn't state a specific request for Sullust defence, still be smart with donations.  Donate items like speeders, snipers, or probe droids which are particularly great for war defence. Do not give units like dewbacks, shock troopers, or repair droids as that'll assist the enemy in grabbing more uplinks.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Outposts</h3>
          <p>
            Outposts often dictate the tide of war. Pay close attention as this is probably our most detail-oriented war tactic and can make or break the team.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a war starts, don't start grabbing outposts. Instead, wait for the opposing squad to take it first. Each outpost (op) starts as a level 5 base. Each time it is captured it will raise a level and become more challenging to capture. Level 9 ops are the most challenging to capture.  We let the opposing team take ops first so we attain them at level 9. Here's what we hope will happen for all ops.
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Enemy grabs level 5 op which becomes level 6 on capture.</li>
              <li>We capture it back and the op becomes level 7.</li>
              <li>They take it again and it's now level 8.</li>
              <li>We take it, the op is now level 9 and is most difficult for the enemy to capture back.</li>
            </ol>
          <p>
            As teams start capturing bases, carefully follow these guidelines</p>
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                If an opposing team has an op, <strong>don't attack bases</strong>. That's using an attack at a disadvantage. Either get the op back or wait for another squad member to get it back.
              </li>
              <li>
                Capture bases comparable to your level.  If you're a level 6-7, capture the level 6 base. If you're level 8, capture the level 8 bases. Don't force players of higher level to waste attacks on easy targets.
              </li>
              <li>
                If an enemy gets one or multiple ops, work together to get them back <strong>ASAP</strong>! Get them back if you can. If not, donate to those who can.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Don't be a D*ck</h3>
          <p>
            The squad is full of nice, groovy people and we have to keep it that way to keep things fun. We refer people to this page so that team strategy is easier to understand, we're winning wars, and we all have fun!
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p style="margin: 30px 0">
        Thank you for taking the time to read this! We welcome you to the squad and hope share many victories with you!
